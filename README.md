## "The Impact of College Education on Geographic Mobility" Replication Materials
These materials can be used to reproduce the main estimating data sets in "The Impact of College Education on Geographic Mobility," coauthored with Ofer Malamud, and published in the Journal of Human Resources (2012) 47(4): 913-950.

Unfortunately many of the original data construction and estimation files for this project were lost in a series of computer and institution transitions. However, all data and construction code for the state and birthyear cohort induction risk measures is available in the form originally used in the paper. We have also re-constructed the estimating sample based on decadal Census data that is summarized in Table 1 of the paper. 

Further detail on the code and data available in this repository can be found in [detail.md](detail.md).
